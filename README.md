# Reflections Jewellery

---

Before beginning this course, a family friend said that when I'm finished they would be interested in commissioning a website from me for their new small business selling handmade jewellery.

So I saw our first milestone project as the perfect opportunity for starting this! Perhaps it will ultimately become my first professionally produced site as a software developer.

## UX

User Stories:

1) As the business owner, I want to be able to advertise my products, provide information about them and tell prospective customers about my design background. I want people to be able to easily contact me so that I can receive orders in a professional manner. 

2) As a prospective customer, I want to be able to see lots of example images of the product, find out more information about them and make an order enquiry.

3) As an organiser of markets/fairs/shows, I want to be able to find local artisans who could exhibit at my events. I need to be able to see that they have a professional approach and provide quality products.
