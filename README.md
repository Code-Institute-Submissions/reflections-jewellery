# Reflections Jewellery

Before beginning this course, a family friend said that when I'm finished they would be interested in commissioning a website from me for their new small business selling handmade jewellery.

So I saw our first milestone project as the perfect opportunity for starting this! Perhaps it will ultimately become my first professionally produced site as a software developer.

## UX

My idea for the site was partly inspired by the whiskey walkthrough project we have previously completed on the course. I liked the way it showcased simplicity yet style.

The basic 'single page' approach seems like a very good fit for a small business which has really only just got up and running. There aren't many products to showcase yet, nor is there a significant amount of information to present.

Therefore a simple landing page with a call to action, a contact form, some 'About' information, product photos and social media links feels ideal.

The website is primarily intended to be a promotional tool for the business, with an opportunity for potential customers to enquire about placing an order or making a purchase.

### User Stories

* As the business owner, I want to be able to advertise my products, provide information about them and tell prospective customers about my design background. I want people to be able to easily contact me so that I can receive orders in a professional manner. 
* As a prospective customer, I want to be able to see example images of the product, find out more information about them and make an order enquiry.
* As an organiser of markets/fairs/shows, I want to be able to find local artisans who could exhibit at my events. I need to be able to see that they have a professional approach and provide quality products.

I used Balsamiq to create some basic wireframes for the project, they further illustrate the layout and content ideas which I outlined above.

## Features

### Existing Features

* The navigation menu provides clear and simple links to the site's different content areas.
* The landing page features a 'call to action' button, while also informing the user what the product is and how they can make bespoke orders.
* The 'About' section details the who, where and what of the business; potential customers know the products come from a professional designer.
* The contact form allows users to easily submit an enquiry and provides some basic guidelines for their message.
* The Facebook embed is a cross-promotional tool for the business owner. It also provides regularly updated additional content, while users can like and message the page through the widget's built-in functionality.
* The 'Products' page provides sample images and details of the materials used.
* In the footer, users can click icons to be taken to the brand's social media pages, send an email or return to the top of the site.

### Features left to implement

* A showcase video of a piece of jewellery in production would allow users to see and hear more about the professional design process.
* A greater selection of images presented in a more stylish manner.
* Product prices, buy online, shopping cart, secure payment process, etc.
* Testimonials from customers and event organisers, plus some simple added functionality to 'book me for your jewellery fair'.
